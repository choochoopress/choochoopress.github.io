As I type this, all I can hear are the birds outside my window, perched out on a tree branch
that’s swaying back and forth. Every few minutes, a siren will start blaring, so loud you can hear
it course up and out of the streets, seeping into all of the apartments. I don’t know whether that
siren is taking someone away, or picking someone up, but I know, under my skin and down to
my bones, that it is for someone who is sick. When it fades, I can still hear the birds, chirping.
I try to still go on runs, but it’s hard, especially when I see all of these people in masks,
crouching away from one another. I hate seeing the look on someone’s face when I pass them
too closely. I hate feeling myself flinch back.
Mostly I stay inside now, reading. I taped up this poem on my wall. I can’t stop thinking about it.

Why should we hurry -- why indeed?
When every way we fly
We are molested equally
By immortality.
No respite from the inference
That this which is begun,
Though where its labors lie
A bland uncertainty
Besets the sight
This mighty night --

I feel different every time I read it--confusion, grief, dread--but the ending always agitates me: I
can’t stand that a bland uncertainty could so continuously fuck up one’s ‘sight’ and ruin all sense
of insight or meaning or truth in one go, no end, just blankness stretching out indefinitely,
(infinitely?) stifling everything.
Yours in everything,
Taylor

        <div id="paristext"><p>Taylor and Emily became friends in Paris. They both ordered kir royales and steak tartare at their first lunch. At the time, and still to this day, this detail seemed important, prescient. Afterwards, they were inseparable; they spent their mornings constructing elaborate and detailed plans for their days, which they promptly discarded, preferring to half-live in museums, parks, and the cheese aisle of Monoprix.</p></div>
